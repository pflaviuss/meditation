# meditation 
Made this meditation app while getting back at learning, after a quite long break.
Besides of the html and css code, I am going to write down every single thing that I make in javascript to try to understand better what I am doing, while following along the tutorial of @developedbyed on youtube.

Firstly, I am starting the javascript code by writing down a function called app, that is gonna be an arrow function. In the app function I am going to select the song by making the variable song, that is gonna select the song by using document.querySelector('.song')
